    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix.
        Crispy tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this impressive meal. This recipe takes a little
        time but it's so worth it!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Dried Chile Peppers</strong>: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and
            ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Beef</strong>: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasonings</strong>: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Olive Oil</strong>: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tomatoes</strong>: Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vinegar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tortillas</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Onion</strong> and <strong>Cilantro</strong>: Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch
            of flavor and texture.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool.
                Drain, reserving some water.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes, vinegar, and seasonings.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook until the meat begins to fall apart,
                basting often. Allow the meat to rest, then shred.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro.
            </p>
